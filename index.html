        <p>
          We are here to do our part for our planet Earth (with a little help from you, of course): to substitute
          single-use plastic water bottles in the F&B industry with eco-friendly and sustainable glass bottles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did you know that glass bottles are considered the most environmentally friendly when it comes to storing
          everyday beverages such as water?
          <b class="cyan-color">‘Surayee’</b> means an earthen pot; and through us, you get the best of both worlds –
          our
          products contain all the
          goodness of alkaline water packaged in a way that is good for the Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s better? We are <b class="cyan-color">affordable</b> because we truly believe that <b
            class="cyan-color">sustaining our climate and natural resources
            shouldn’t come at a large premium.</b>
